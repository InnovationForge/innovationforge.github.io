In today's complex regulatory environment, maintaining compliance can be a daunting task. Automated compliance within DevSecOps simplifies this by embedding process for ensuring regulatory adherence through automation checks directly into the development and deployment pipelines.

- **Automated Checks:** Compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS often mandate specific security measures. Automated tools can continuously verify that the code adheres to these standards, flagging any violations immediately.
  
- **Audit Trails:** Automated systems can maintain detailed logs of all activities, providing a transparent audit trail. This is crucial for demonstrating compliance during audits and for internal reviews.
  
- **Policy as Code:** Just like Infrastructure as Code (IaC), policy as code allows compliance policies to be codified. This ensures that compliance checks are consistent and repeatable, reducing the risk of human error.

By integrating these automated compliance checks into the CI/CD pipeline, organizations can ensure that their software meets regulatory requirements without slowing down development.
