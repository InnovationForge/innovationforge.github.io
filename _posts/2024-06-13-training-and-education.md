Continuous training and education are vital to keep teams updated on the latest security threats and best practices and empowering them with Knowledge and Skills. This is particularly important in a DevSecOps environment where the security landscape is constantly evolving.

- **Regular Training Sessions:** Schedule regular training sessions on security fundamentals, emerging threats, and new security tools and techniques. This ensures that all team members are knowledgeable about current security challenges and solutions.
  
- **Hands-On Workshops:** Provide hands-on workshops and simulations to allow team members to practice responding to security incidents. This practical experience is invaluable in preparing teams to handle real-world threats.
  
- **Certifications and Courses:** Encourage team members to pursue relevant certifications and courses. This not only enhances their skills but also demonstrates the organizationâ€™s commitment to professional development.
  
- **Security Champions:** Designate security champions within development and operations teams. These individuals can serve as go-to resources for security questions and help in disseminating security knowledge throughout the organization.

Ongoing training and education ensure that security is not a one-time effort but a continuous journey. Empowered with the latest knowledge and skills, teams can proactively address security challenges, contributing to a more secure software development lifecycle.
