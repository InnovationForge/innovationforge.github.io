When designing REST APIs, adhering to best practices and standards ensures that your APIs are easy to use, maintain, and scale. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide to the rules of REST API design categorized into "Must Do," "Should Do," "May Do," "Must Not," and "Should Not."

#### Must Do

1. **Use HTTP Methods Correctly**:
    - **GET** for retrieving resources.
    - **POST** for creating resources.
    - **PUT** for updating or replacing resources.
    - **DELETE** for removing resources.
    - **PATCH** for partial updates to resources.

2. **Use Meaningful URIs**:
    - URIs should be clear and represent the resource hierarchy.
    - Example: `/users/123` for a specific user resource.

3. **Return Appropriate Status Codes**:
    - **200 OK** for successful GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.
    - **201 Created** for successful POST requests.
    - **204 No Content** for successful DELETE requests.
    - **400 Bad Request** for invalid requests.
    - **404 Not Found** for non-existing resources.
    - **500 Internal Server Error** for server-side errors.

4. **Use Plural Nouns for Resource Names**:
    - Example: `/users` instead of `/user`.

5. **Version Your API**:
    - Use versioning in URIs or headers.
    - Example: `/v1/users` or `Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json`.

6. **Document Your API**:
    - Provide comprehensive and clear documentation.
    - Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation.

#### Should Do

1. **Use HTTPS**:
    - Ensure secure communication by using HTTPS.

2. **Implement Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting**:
    - Allow clients to paginate large datasets.
    - Provide filtering options to refine results.
    - Enable sorting of results by different fields.

3. **Provide Consistent and Descriptive Error Messages**:
    - Include meaningful error messages and codes in responses.
    - Use a consistent error format.

4. **Support HATEOAS**:
    - Include hyperlinks in responses to guide clients on available actions.
    - Example: Provide links to related resources.

5. **Use HTTP Headers Appropriately**:
    - Utilize headers for metadata, such as `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, and `Cache-Control`.

6. **Validate and Sanitize Input**:
    - Ensure input data is validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.

#### May Do

1. **Use Caching**:
    - Implement caching for GET requests to improve performance.
    - Use headers like `ETag` and `Cache-Control`.

2. **Provide Rate Limiting**:
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.

3. **Support Multiple Content Types**:
    - Allow clients to request and receive data in different formats, such as JSON or XML.

4. **Use Query Parameters for Optional Filters**:
    - Use query parameters for optional data and filtering.
    - Example: `/users?status=active`.

#### Must Not

1. **Use Actions or Verbs in URIs**:
    - Avoid using verbs in URIs; use resource names instead.
    - Bad: `/getUser` or `/updateUser`.
    - Good: `/users/{id}`.

2. **Break Backward Compatibility**:
    - Avoid making changes that break existing clients.
    - Use versioning to introduce breaking changes.

3. **Expose Internal Implementation Details**:
    - Do not leak internal server or database details in the API.

#### Should Not

1. **Use Long URIs**:
    - Keep URIs concise and readable.
    - Avoid deeply nested resource URIs.

2. **Return Sensitive Data**:
    - Do not return sensitive information such as passwords or private user data.

3. **Mix Resource Representations**:
    - Ensure consistency in how resources are represented across different endpoints.

4. **Overload HTTP Methods**:
    - Do not misuse HTTP methods; follow their intended purpose.

### Conclusion

Following these REST API design guidelines ensures that your APIs are robust, user-friendly, and maintainable. By adhering to the "Must Do" and "Should Do" rules, you ensure that your API is well-structured and secure. Considering the "May Do" suggestions can enhance functionality, while avoiding the "Must Not" and "Should Not" practices prevents common pitfalls and ensures a consistent and reliable API.
